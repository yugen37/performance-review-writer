# Corporate Secretary Notification - Draft
**Send Date: Monday, November 10, 2024**  
**Recipient: Corporate Secretary, AltaGas**  
**Purpose: Board-level governance concerns notification**

## 📧 EMAIL DRAFT

**Subject:** Notification of Governance Concerns Requiring Board-Level Attention

---

Dear [Corporate Secretary Name],

I am writing to notify you of governance concerns requiring board-level attention, as required under AltaGas's governance policies and securities regulations.

## Summary of Governance Concerns

### 1. Ethics Committee Member Violations
Ethics Committee members violated AltaGas's own investigation policies and procedures, representing board-level governance failures that cannot be delegated or minimized.

### 2. Securities Law Implications
The investigation process and its outcomes raise concerns under:
- **NI 52-110** (Audit Committees): Board accountability for compliance systems
- **NI 52-109** (Certification of Disclosure): Board responsibility for internal controls

These securities law citations create regulatory exposure that requires board-level attention, as board accountability cannot be delegated.

### 3. Investigation Process Violations
The investigation process failed to follow AltaGas's own policies, with documented inconsistencies including:
- Contradictory statements regarding the necessity of a live interview ("CRITICAL" vs. "GOOD UNDERSTANDING" without it)
- Failure to investigate fraud allegations as required
- Process violations that demonstrate bad faith

### 4. Documented Evidence
I have documented evidence including:
- Recorded admissions
- Email thread (September 16 - October 22, 2024) showing investigation process violations
- Documented inconsistencies that cannot be reconciled

## Attempted Resolution

I attempted to resolve these governance concerns through direct communication:
- **October 31, 2024:** Sent comprehensive positioning statement outlining governance concerns and securities law implications
- **November 6, 2024:** Followed up regarding settlement discussions
- **Response received:** Treated as investigation participation rather than governance concerns requiring board attention

Despite these attempts, AltaGas has not addressed the governance concerns or engaged in meaningful settlement discussions that would address both the employment matters and the underlying governance failures.

## Current Status

As these governance concerns require board-level attention and cannot be resolved through continued investigation participation, I am providing this notification as required under AltaGas's governance policies.

I remain open to settlement discussions that would comprehensively address both the employment matters and these governance concerns, avoiding the need for regulatory involvement or public disclosure.

## Attachments

1. **October 31, 2024 Positioning Statement** - Comprehensive outline of governance concerns and securities law implications
2. **Email Thread (September 16 - October 22, 2024)** - Documentation of investigation process violations
3. **Supporting Documentation** - Evidence of recorded admissions and documented inconsistencies

## Request

I request that the Board:
1. Review these governance concerns
2. Address the Ethics Committee member violations
3. Assess the securities law implications
4. Determine appropriate resolution that addresses both employment matters and governance failures

I am available to provide additional information or documentation as needed.

I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
[Your Contact Information]

## 🎯 STRATEGIC NOTES

### What This Accomplishes
1. **Follows through on deadline** - Maintains credibility
2. **Escalates to board level** - Where governance concerns belong
3. **Maintains leverage** - All leverage points still active
4. **Keeps settlement door open** - Can still settle after notification
5. **Professional and credible** - Shows you're serious but reasonable

### What Happens Next (Likely Scenarios)

**Scenario A: Board Takes It Seriously**
- Board reviews governance concerns
- May request meeting/discussion
- May direct settlement discussions
- **Your response:** Engage professionally, maintain leverage

**Scenario B: They Finally Engage in Settlement**
- After board notification, they realize you're serious
- May offer settlement to avoid board/regulatory involvement
- **Your response:** Use Response Matrix, maintain $1M floor

**Scenario C: They Still Stonewall**
- Board may not respond or may dismiss
- **Your response:** Consider regulatory filing (securities commission)
- Settlement still possible, but leverage changes

**Scenario D: They Try to Minimize**
- May try to frame as employment matter only
- **Your response:** Re-emphasize governance concerns, securities law

### Key Principles
1. **Professional** - Never emotional, always credible
2. **Factual** - Everything must be accurate and documented
3. **Comprehensive** - Covers all governance concerns
4. **Maintains leverage** - All leverage points still active
