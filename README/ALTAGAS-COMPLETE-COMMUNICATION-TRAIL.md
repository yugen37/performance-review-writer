## FINAL POSITIONING STATEMENT (October 31, 2024)

**Source:** `~/Desktop/Oak/Final Positioning Statement.pdf`  
**Recipients:** Amy Schuh, Kamaria Ellis, Vern Yu  
**Focus:** Investigation process violations and procedural inconsistencies (Sep 16 - Oct 22, 2025)

### KEY FOCUS:
- **NOT rehashing original allegations** - focuses on HOW AltaGas handled the investigation
- Investigation process violations and procedural inconsistencies
- Securities law citations (NI 52-110, NI 52-109)

### FIVE DOCUMENTED FACTUAL INCONSISTENCIES:

#### 1. Audit Committee Oversight Unconfirmed
- Four explicit requests for confirmation went unanswered
- CEO confirmed COBE (management function) leading investigation, not Board-level oversight
- Whistleblower complaint involving Board-reporting executives investigated by management

#### 2. Investigation Scope Narrowed After Accommodation Request
- Sep 16: Investigation into Sep 10 governance complaint
- Sep 17: Health accommodation requested (written format)
- Oct 7: Accommodation granted BUT scope narrowed to Sep 1 resignation email only
- Zero questions about governance violations; all 8 questions focused on resignation content

#### 3. Investigator Independence Unclarified
- Represented as "external investigator" suggesting independence
- Then identified as legal counsel: "AltaGas retained my firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP"
- Direct question about dual role (investigator vs. legal counsel) remained unanswered

#### 4. Investigation Design Contradictions
- Amy Schuh: Live interview "CRITICAL" and "NECESSARY" - written format would "LIMIT ability to investigate"
- Kamaria Ellis: Accommodation granted, but claims "GOOD UNDERSTANDING" of governance concerns without that participation
- Internal contradiction: Either live format wasn't necessary, or investigation proceeded despite limitations

#### 5. Procedural Safeguards Unanswered
- Multiple requests for procedural information went unanswered:
  - Retaliation reporting procedures
  - Investigation stages/steps
  - Audit Committee oversight confirmation
  - Investigator independence/clarity

### SECURITIES LAW CITATIONS:
- **NI 52-110** (Audit Committee standards)
- **NI 52-109** (Certification of Disclosure Controls)
- Governance concerns: Ethics Committee member (David Marks) committing violations
- Pattern of governance failures at senior leadership levels
- Board oversight responsibilities under securities regulations

### TIMELINE CONTEXT:
- **Oct 31, 2024:** Final positioning statement sent (warning before escalation)
- **Nov 10, 2024:** Corporate Secretary notification deadline (10 days to respond)
- This communication positioned before board-level escalation
