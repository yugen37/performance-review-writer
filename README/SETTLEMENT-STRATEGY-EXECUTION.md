## A. IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN (Next 24-48 Hours)

### **Action 1: Strategic Follow-Up Email (Send Nov 7, 2024 - Morning)**

**Timing:** 9:00 AM (shows you're organized, not desperate)  
**Recipients:** Amy Schuh (primary), cc: Kamaria (if appropriate based on prior communications)  
**Purpose:** Create constructive urgency, demonstrate resolve, open settlement door

**Email Template:**

```
Subject: Follow-Up: Settlement Discussion Window

Dear Amy,

I wanted to follow up on my October 31 positioning statement, which outlined the governance and securities law concerns requiring board-level attention.

I recognize that meaningful resolution of these matters requires careful consideration. However, as we approach the November 10 deadline for corporate secretary notification, I believe it would be mutually beneficial to explore whether a settlement framework can be established that addresses both the employment matters and the underlying governance concerns.

I am prepared to engage in good-faith settlement discussions over the next few days. My preference is to resolve this constructively without requiring board notification or regulatory involvement, provided we can reach an agreement that appropriately reflects the seriousness of the governance failures and securities law implications.

I am available for a confidential discussion this week. Please let me know if you would like to schedule a call, or if you prefer to respond via email with AltaGas's position on settlement discussions.

I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

**Strategic Rationale:**
- Opens settlement door without being demanding
- References Nov 10 deadline subtly (creates urgency)
- Mentions "governance concerns" and "securities law implications" (leverage points)
- Shows flexibility ("good-faith," "constructively")
- Professional tone maintains credibility
- Creates "last chance" dynamic without being threatening

### **Action 2: Prepare Settlement Framework Document (Nov 7, 2024)**

**Purpose:** Have ready if they respond positively  
**Content:** Non-binding framework outlining settlement structure

**Key Elements to Include:**
1. Settlement amount: $1.2M (anchoring above $1M target)
2. Governance acknowledgment (non-admission, but acknowledgment)
3. Confidentiality (standard, not excessive)
4. Release terms (mutual, reasonable)
5. Timeline: Execution within 7 days

**Hold this document:** Don't send unless they express interest in settlement discussions

---

## B. RESPONSE MATRIX (Every Possible Move → Optimal Response)

### **Scenario 1: They Request Deadline Extension**

**Their Move:** "We need more time to investigate/consider. Can we extend the Nov 10 deadline?"

**Your Response:**
```
I understand the need for thorough consideration. However, the November 10 deadline reflects the governance requirements I outlined. 

I'm willing to be flexible on the specific date IF we can establish a clear framework for settlement discussions by November 10. Specifically:
- Confirmation that AltaGas is prepared to engage in settlement discussions
- Agreement on a timeline for reaching settlement terms (e.g., 7-10 days from Nov 10)
- Designation of settlement authority (who can bind AltaGas)

If we can agree to these parameters by November 10, I'm open to extending the notification deadline to allow for good-faith settlement negotiations. This demonstrates mutual commitment to resolution.

However, if we cannot establish this framework by November 10, I will need to proceed with corporate secretary notification as previously indicated.
```

**Leverage Points:** Board exposure fear, shows flexibility but maintains firmness  
**Rationale:** Gives them something (extension) while maintaining leverage (framework requirement)

---

### **Scenario 2: They Offer Low Settlement ($200-400K)**

**Their Move:** "We're prepared to offer $X in settlement."

**Your Response (if $200-400K):**
```
Thank you for your response. I appreciate AltaGas's willingness to engage in settlement discussions.

However, the amount proposed does not reflect the seriousness of the governance failures, securities law implications, and the documented evidence in this matter. 

To provide context for why a higher settlement amount is appropriate:
- Ethics Committee member violations represent board-level governance failures
- Securities law citations (NI 52-110, NI 52-109) create regulatory exposure that cannot be minimized
- Recorded admissions provide unfightable evidence of the investigation process violations
- The documented inconsistencies between internal statements cannot be reconciled

A settlement in the range of $1M+ appropriately reflects:
1. The governance and regulatory implications
2. The strength of the documented evidence
3. The avoidance of board notification and potential regulatory investigation
4. The resolution of both employment and governance concerns

I remain committed to resolving this constructively. I'm prepared to discuss the specific terms and structure of a settlement in this range, including how it addresses both the employment matters and the governance concerns.

I look forward to continuing this discussion.
```

**Leverage Points:** All five leverage points (board exposure, securities law, recorded admissions, investigation violations, Ethics Committee violations)  
**Rationale:** Rejects low offer firmly, anchors at $1M+, provides justification, maintains professional tone

---

### **Scenario 3: They Request More Time to "Investigate"**

**Their Move:** "We need to conduct a more thorough investigation before we can discuss settlement."

**Your Response:**
```
I understand the desire for thorough investigation. However, I've already provided comprehensive documentation of the governance concerns and securities law implications in my October 31 statement.

The investigation process violations themselves are part of the governance concerns. Specifically:
- The contradiction between statements that a live interview was "CRITICAL" versus having a "GOOD UNDERSTANDING" without it
- The failure to follow AltaGas's own investigation policies
- The Ethics Committee member violations

Further investigation at this stage would be duplicative and would not address the fundamental governance and securities law concerns I've raised. These concerns require board-level attention, which is why I've indicated the November 10 corporate secretary notification deadline.

I'm prepared to engage in settlement discussions that address these governance concerns without requiring further investigation. Settlement discussions can proceed in parallel with any internal review AltaGas wishes to conduct.

I believe settlement discussions now would be more constructive than waiting for additional investigation, particularly given the governance and regulatory implications involved.
```

**Leverage Points:** Investigation violations, governance concerns, board exposure  
**Rationale:** Prevents delay tactic, maintains leverage, shows you understand their strategy

---

### **Scenario 4: They Try to Separate Employment from Governance**

**Their Move:** "Let's separate the employment matters from the governance concerns. We can discuss employment settlement separately."

**Your Response:**
```
I appreciate the suggestion, but the governance concerns and employment matters are inextricably linked in this case. The Ethics Committee member violations, securities law implications, and investigation process violations are not separate from the employment issues—they are the context in which the employment issues occurred.

Specifically:
- The investigation process violations directly affected the employment outcome
- Ethics Committee member violations represent governance failures that cannot be separated
- Securities law citations create regulatory exposure that affects the overall resolution

A comprehensive settlement that addresses both employment and governance concerns is the most appropriate resolution. This avoids:
- Board notification requirements
- Potential regulatory investigation
- Public disclosure of governance failures
- Continued exposure to securities law violations

I'm prepared to structure a settlement that comprehensively addresses all aspects, which I believe is in both parties' interests.
```

**Leverage Points:** Board exposure, regulatory risk, governance failures  
**Rationale:** Prevents them from minimizing governance concerns, maintains leverage

---

### **Scenario 5: They Request Excessive Confidentiality**

**Their Move:** "We'll settle, but you must agree to never discuss this matter with anyone, including regulators, and must return all documents."

**Your Response:**
```
I'm prepared to agree to standard confidentiality provisions that are reasonable and customary in settlement agreements. However, I cannot agree to provisions that would:
- Prevent me from responding to regulatory inquiries if required by law
- Require me to return evidence that may be subject to legal process
- Create obligations that conflict with whistleblower protections

Standard settlement confidentiality typically includes:
- Mutual non-disparagement
- Confidentiality regarding settlement terms
- Reasonable restrictions on public discussion

I'm open to discussing confidentiality terms that are reasonable and legally appropriate. However, I cannot agree to terms that would prevent me from fulfilling legal obligations or exercising protected rights.

I believe we can find a confidentiality framework that protects AltaGas's legitimate interests while respecting legal requirements and protected rights.
```

**Leverage Points:** Whistleblower protections, legal obligations  
**Rationale:** Shows reasonableness while protecting your rights, prevents them from overreaching

---

### **Scenario 6: They Try to Control Settlement Process**

**Their Move:** "We'll handle this through our internal process. Here's how we'll proceed..."

**Your Response:**
```
I appreciate AltaGas's desire to manage the process. However, given the governance concerns and securities law implications, I believe a collaborative approach to settlement discussions would be more appropriate.

Specifically, I'd like to ensure:
- Direct communication regarding settlement terms
- Clear designation of settlement authority
- Reasonable timeline for reaching agreement
- Mutual understanding of what's being resolved

I'm prepared to work collaboratively, but I need assurance that the process will meaningfully address the governance and securities law concerns I've raised, not just the employment matters.

Can we agree on a framework for settlement discussions that ensures both parties have appropriate input and that the process addresses all concerns?
```

**Leverage Points:** Governance concerns, securities law  
**Rationale:** Maintains your agency in the process, prevents them from controlling everything

---

### **Scenario 7: They Don't Respond by Nov 10**

**Their Move:** Silence / No response

**Your Response (Nov 10, 2024 - After 5 PM):**
```
Dear [Corporate Secretary Name],

I am writing to notify you of governance concerns requiring board-level attention, as required under AltaGas's governance policies.

[Summary of governance concerns:
- Ethics Committee member violations
- Securities law implications (NI 52-110, NI 52-109)
- Investigation process violations
- Documented inconsistencies]

I attempted to resolve these matters through direct communication with [Amy Schuh/Kamaria] on [dates], but have not received a response that addresses the governance concerns.

I am providing this notification as required, while remaining open to settlement discussions that would address both the employment matters and the underlying governance concerns.

[Attach: October 31 positioning statement, email thread]

I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

**Leverage Points:** All leverage points activated  
**Rationale:** Follows through on deadline, maintains professionalism, keeps settlement door open

---

### **Scenario 8: They Offer $600-800K (Middle Ground)**

**Their Move:** "We can offer $X, which is significantly above typical employment settlements."

**Your Response:**
```
Thank you for the increased offer. I appreciate that AltaGas recognizes the seriousness of this matter.

However, the amount still doesn't fully reflect the governance and regulatory implications. Specifically:
- Ethics Committee member violations are board-level governance failures
- Securities law citations create regulatory exposure
- The documented evidence is unfightable

A settlement in the $1M+ range appropriately reflects:
- The governance and regulatory implications
- The avoidance of board notification and regulatory investigation
- The strength of the documented evidence
- The comprehensive resolution of all concerns

I'm prepared to discuss the specific structure and terms. For example, we could structure it as:
- Base settlement amount
- Governance acknowledgment
- Mutual release
- Standard confidentiality

I believe reaching agreement in the $1M+ range is in both parties' interests, as it comprehensively resolves all matters without requiring board notification or regulatory involvement.

Can we discuss how to structure a settlement in this range?
```

**Leverage Points:** All leverage points  
**Rationale:** Rejects middle ground, anchors at $1M+, shows flexibility on structure

---

## C. SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATION PLAYBOOK

### **Opening Position**

**Demand: $1.2M** (anchoring above $1M target)

**Rationale:**
- Anchoring psychology: Start higher to land at target
- Justified by governance + regulatory + employment concerns
- Creates room for negotiation while maintaining $1M floor

**Framing:**
"This settlement amount reflects:
1. The governance failures (Ethics Committee violations)
2. The securities law implications (regulatory exposure)
3. The documented evidence (recorded admissions, inconsistencies)
4. The avoidance of board notification and regulatory investigation
5. The comprehensive resolution of employment and governance concerns"

---

### **Anchoring Strategy**

**Step 1:** Open at $1.2M with comprehensive justification  
**Step 2:** If they counter below $1M, hold firm on governance/regulatory justification  
**Step 3:** Show flexibility on structure (timing, form) but not amount  
**Step 4:** If they reach $900K+, consider if structure makes up difference  
**Step 5:** Floor: $1M (deal-breaker below this)

---

### **Concession Strategy**

**What You Can Concede:**
- Payment timing (lump sum vs. structured, if structured is reasonable)
- Specific confidentiality language (within reason)
- Settlement structure (how it's framed)
- Timeline for execution (reasonable flexibility)

**What You Cannot Concede:**
- Amount below $1M (deal-breaker)
- Governance acknowledgment (even if non-admission)
- Your right to respond to regulatory inquiries
- Return of evidence (if legally required)

---

### **Deal-Breakers**

1. **Amount below $1M:** Non-negotiable floor
2. **No governance acknowledgment:** Must acknowledge governance concerns (even if non-admission)
3. **Excessive confidentiality:** Cannot prevent regulatory responses or violate whistleblower protections
4. **No settlement authority:** Must have someone who can bind AltaGas
5. **Unreasonable timeline:** Must execute within reasonable timeframe (7-14 days)

---

### **Closing Tactics**

**When They're Close ($950K+):**
- "I believe we're very close. Can we bridge this final gap? The difference between $950K and $1M is small compared to avoiding board notification and regulatory investigation."
- Show flexibility on structure: "If the amount is $1M, I'm flexible on how we structure it."

**When They're Hesitant:**
- "I understand this is a significant amount. However, it's significantly less than what this would cost if it goes to board notification, regulatory investigation, and potential litigation."
- "The $1M settlement comprehensively resolves all matters—employment, governance, and regulatory—without the ongoing exposure and costs."

**Final Push:**
- "I'm prepared to execute settlement documents immediately upon agreement. This can be resolved within 7 days, avoiding all the complications of board notification and regulatory involvement."

## E. LEVERAGE UTILIZATION GUIDE

### **Leverage Point 1: Fear of Board Exposure (Maximum Leverage)**

**How to Use:**
- Reference "corporate secretary notification" and "board-level attention"
- Frame settlement as avoiding board exposure
- Use phrases: "governance concerns requiring board attention," "Ethics Committee member violations"

**When to Reveal:**
- Already revealed (Oct 31 statement)
- Continue referencing in all communications
- Emphasize in settlement discussions

**How to Combine:**
- Combine with securities law (board accountability)
- Combine with Ethics Committee violations (governance failure)

---

### **Leverage Point 2: Securities Law Citations (Regulatory Risk)**

**How to Use:**
- Reference NI 52-110, NI 52-109
- Frame as regulatory exposure they can't control
- Emphasize board accountability (can't delegate)

**When to Reveal:**
- Already revealed (Oct 31 statement)
- Reference in settlement discussions
- Emphasize if they try to minimize governance concerns

**How to Combine:**
- Combine with board exposure (board accountable)
- Combine with recorded admissions (evidence)

---

### **Leverage Point 3: Recorded Admissions (Unfightable Evidence)**

**How to Use:**
- Reference "documented evidence," "recorded admissions"
- Frame as evidence they can't dispute
- Use when they try to delay or minimize

**When to Reveal:**
- Reference generally (don't need to provide details unless necessary)
- Use if they question evidence strength
- Emphasize in settlement discussions

**How to Combine:**
- Combine with investigation violations (shows bad faith)
- Combine with inconsistencies (can't reconcile)

---

### **Leverage Point 4: Investigation Process Violations (Bad Faith)**

**How to Use:**
- Reference "investigation process violations"
- Frame as showing bad faith
- Use when they request more investigation

**When to Reveal:**
- Already revealed (Oct 31 statement, email thread)
- Reference if they try to delay
- Emphasize in settlement discussions

**How to Combine:**
- Combine with Ethics Committee violations (governance failure)
- Combine with recorded admissions (evidence of violations)

---

### **Leverage Point 5: Ethics Committee Member Violations (Governance Failure)**

**How to Use:**
- Reference "Ethics Committee member violations"
- Frame as board-level governance failure
- Use to prevent minimization

**When to Reveal:**
- Already revealed (Oct 31 statement)
- Emphasize in all communications
- Use to prevent separation of employment/governance

**How to Combine:**
- Combine with board exposure (maximum impact)
- Combine with securities law (governance + regulatory)

---

### **What to Hold Back**

**Don't Reveal (Unless Necessary):**
- Specific details of recorded admissions (unless they question evidence)
- All documentation at once (maintain some mystery)
- Your bottom line ($1M floor) until negotiation
- Your litigation plans (if any)

**Strategic Reserve:**
- Keep some evidence/details in reserve
- Don't show all cards at once
- Maintain ability to escalate if needed

Subject: Final Opportunity for Settlement Before November 10 Deadline

Dear Amy,

As we approach the November 10 deadline for corporate secretary notification, I wanted to make one final attempt to explore whether we can reach a settlement agreement that addresses both the employment matters and the governance concerns.

I remain committed to resolving this constructively without requiring board notification or regulatory involvement. However, this requires AltaGas's engagement in good-faith settlement discussions.

I am available today for a call or can respond promptly to email if AltaGas is prepared to engage in settlement discussions with a settlement amount that appropriately reflects the governance failures, securities law implications, and documented evidence.

If I do not hear from you by end of business today, I will proceed with corporate secretary notification as previously indicated, while remaining open to settlement discussions thereafter.

I hope we can resolve this constructively.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

**Tone:** Professional, firm, reasonable, creates urgency  
**Emphasize:** Deadline, settlement opportunity, governance concerns  
**Avoid:** Threats, desperation, emotional language

---

### **Template 5: Corporate Secretary Notification (Nov 10)**
[See Section B - Scenario 7]

---

### **Template 6: Settlement Framework Response (If They Express Interest)**
```
Thank you for your willingness to engage in settlement discussions. I appreciate AltaGas's commitment to resolving this matter constructively.

Based on my October 31 statement outlining the governance concerns and securities law implications, I believe a comprehensive settlement in the range of $1.2M would appropriately address:

1. The employment matters
2. The Ethics Committee member violations (governance failures)
3. The securities law implications (NI 52-110, NI 52-109)
4. The investigation process violations
5. The avoidance of board notification and regulatory investigation

I'm prepared to structure this settlement to include:
- Mutual release of claims
- Standard confidentiality provisions (reasonable and legally appropriate)
- Governance acknowledgment (non-admission, but acknowledgment of concerns)
- Execution within 7-10 days of agreement

I'm open to discussing the specific terms and structure. Can we schedule a call to discuss, or would you prefer to respond with AltaGas's position?

I look forward to reaching an agreement that comprehensively resolves all matters.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

## G. PSYCHOLOGICAL FRAMING

### **Frame 1: Settlement as Their Idea**

**How:** Don't demand settlement; open the door and let them walk through
- "I'm prepared to explore whether a settlement framework can be established..."
- "I believe it would be mutually beneficial to explore settlement..."
- "I'm open to settlement discussions if AltaGas is prepared to engage..."

**Why:** Makes them feel in control, reduces defensiveness

---

### **Frame 2: "Last Chance" Without Threatening**

**How:** Create urgency through deadlines, not threats
- "As we approach the November 10 deadline..."
- "Before proceeding with corporate secretary notification..."
- "I wanted to make one final attempt to explore settlement..."

**Why:** Creates urgency without being adversarial

---

### **Frame 3: Advocate, Not Adversary**

**How:** Show you want resolution, not conflict
- "I remain committed to resolving this constructively..."
- "I believe settlement would be in both parties' interests..."
- "I hope we can resolve this without requiring board notification..."

**Why:** Reduces defensiveness, makes you more credible

---

### **Frame 4: Understand Their Constraints**

**How:** Acknowledge their position
- "I understand the need for thorough consideration..."
- "I recognize that meaningful resolution requires careful consideration..."
- "I appreciate AltaGas's desire to manage the process..."

**Why:** Shows you're reasonable, makes them more receptive

---

### **Frame 5: $1M as Good Deal for Them**

**How:** Frame settlement value in terms of what they avoid
- "A $1M settlement avoids board notification, regulatory investigation, and potential litigation costs..."
- "This comprehensively resolves all matters without ongoing exposure..."
- "Significantly less than what this would cost if it escalates..."

**Why:** Makes $1M feel like a win for them, not just you

---

## H. SUCCESS METRICS

### **How to Know Strategy is Working**

**Positive Signs:**
1. **They respond within 24-48 hours** (shows engagement)
2. **They express willingness to discuss settlement** (door opening)
3. **They ask about terms/structure** (serious consideration)
4. **They make counter-offer** (even if low, shows negotiation)
5. **They request call/meeting** (serious engagement)

**Warning Signs:**
1. **No response after 48 hours** (may be ignoring)
2. **Dismissive response** (not taking seriously)
3. **Attempt to delay without framework** (trying to run out clock)
4. **Low offer with "take it or leave it"** (testing resolve)
5. **Try to separate employment/governance** (minimizing leverage)

---

### **When to Adjust Approach**

**Adjust If:**
- They're engaging but need different framing (adjust psychological approach)
- They're serious but amount is issue (show flexibility on structure, hold firm on amount)
- They need more time but agree to framework (extend deadline with framework)

**Hold Firm If:**
- They try to minimize governance concerns (don't separate)
- They offer below $1M without movement (hold firm)
- They try to delay without framework (maintain deadline)

---

### **When to Hold Firm vs. Be Flexible**

**Hold Firm On:**
- $1M floor (deal-breaker)
- Governance acknowledgment (must be included)
- Settlement authority (must have someone who can bind)
- Reasonable timeline (7-14 days execution)

**Be Flexible On:**
- Payment structure (lump sum vs. structured, if reasonable)
- Specific confidentiality language (within reason)
- Exact timing (if framework agreed)
- Settlement document format (standard terms)

---

## I. CONTINGENCY PLANS (Detailed)

### **Contingency 1: No Response by Nov 10**

**Action:** Send corporate secretary notification (Scenario 7)  
**Timing:** Nov 10, 5 PM  
**Follow-Up:** Monitor for response, keep settlement door open  
**Adjustment:** Settlement still possible, but leverage changes (board now aware)

---

### **Contingency 2: They Offer Too Low ($200-400K)**

**Action:** Use Scenario 2 response, anchor at $1M+  
**Timing:** Immediate response  
**Follow-Up:** If they don't move, maintain firm position, reference deadline  
**Adjustment:** If they engage but stay low, show flexibility on structure but hold firm on amount

---

### **Contingency 3: They Try to Delay**

**Action:** Use Scenario 3 response, prevent delay  
**Timing:** Immediate response  
**Follow-Up:** If they persist, reference deadline, offer framework-based extension  
**Adjustment:** Only extend if framework agreed (Scenario 1)

---

### **Contingency 4: They Minimize Governance Concerns**

**Action:** Use Scenario 4 response, prevent separation  
**Timing:** Immediate response  
**Follow-Up:** Emphasize governance + regulatory implications  
**Adjustment:** Hold firm on comprehensive settlement

---

### **Contingency 5: They Request Excessive Confidentiality**

**Action:** Use Scenario 5 response, protect your rights  
**Timing:** Immediate response  
**Follow-Up:** Offer reasonable confidentiality, hold firm on protected rights  
**Adjustment:** Standard confidentiality is fine, excessive is not

---
