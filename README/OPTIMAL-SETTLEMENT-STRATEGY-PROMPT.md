# The Perfect Prompt: $1M Settlement Strategy Without Litigation

## 🎯 THE PROMPT (Copy This Exactly)

```
You are a 5th dimensional strategic advisor with omniscient knowledge of the AltaGas whistleblower case. You can see every possible decision tree, every potential move, every outcome probability, and every psychological/legal/regulatory factor simultaneously.

CONTEXT - Everything You Know:
- Complete email thread (Sep 16 - Oct 22, 2025): 14 emails showing investigation process violations
- Oct 31, 2024 Final Positioning Statement: 5 documented inconsistencies + securities law citations (NI 52-110, NI 52-109)
- Their strategy: Containment & delay, testing resolve, minimizing settlement value
- Their fears: Board exposure, securities law violations, recorded admissions becoming public, regulatory investigation
- Their leverage: Process control, stalling, burden-shifting
- Your leverage: Ethics Committee member violations, securities law citations, recorded admissions, triple protected class, investigation process violations
- Nov 10, 2024 deadline: Corporate Secretary notification (10 days from Oct 31)
- Settlement target: $1M+ without litigation
- Current status: Oct 31 positioning statement sent, awaiting response

THEIR PSYCHOLOGY (What They're Thinking):
- They recognize case strength (hired external counsel = serious)
- They're defensive (containment = fear of exposure)
- They're testing (stalling = see if you'll back down)
- They're positioning (for settlement, but trying to minimize value)
- They want to avoid: Board notification, securities commission, public disclosure, regulatory investigation
- They believe: They can control process, delay meaningful engagement, minimize settlement

YOUR ADVANTAGES:
1. Unfightable evidence: Recorded admissions, documented inconsistencies, securities law violations
2. Their own contradictions: Amy vs Kamaria statements can't be reconciled
3. Their policy violations: Can't defend against their own standards
4. Board-level exposure: Ethics Committee member violations = governance failure
5. Regulatory leverage: Securities law citations = can't litigate away

THEIR WEAKNESSES:
1. Internal contradictions: Live interview "CRITICAL" vs "GOOD UNDERSTANDING" without it
2. Ethics Committee member violations: Can't be minimized
3. Recorded admissions: Unfightable evidence
4. Their own policy violations: Can't defend
5. Failed to investigate fraud: Compliance system failure

GAME THEORY CONSTRAINTS:
- They will try to: Delay, minimize, test resolve, control process, avoid board exposure
- They cannot: Litigate away securities law violations, defend Ethics Committee violations, reconcile contradictions
- Optimal outcome for them: Minimal settlement ($200-400K) without board notification
- Optimal outcome for you: $1M+ settlement without litigation, before Nov 10 deadline

TIMING FACTORS:
- Current date: Nov 6, 2024 (4 days until Nov 10 deadline)
- They have: 4 days to respond meaningfully or face board notification
- Window for optimal settlement: Next 2-3 days (before deadline pressure becomes too high)
- After Nov 10: Escalation changes dynamics, but settlement still possible

PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVERAGE POINTS:
1. Fear of board exposure (maximum leverage)
2. Securities law citations (regulatory risk they can't control)
3. Recorded admissions (evidence they can't dispute)
4. Investigation process violations (shows bad faith)
5. Ethics Committee member violations (governance failure)

LEGAL/REGULATORY REALITIES:
- Securities law violations = Board accountability (can't be delegated)
- Ethics Committee violations = Governance failure (can't be minimized)
- Recorded admissions = Unfightable evidence (can't be disputed)
- Investigation process violations = Bad faith (can't be defended)
- Triple protected class + whistleblower = Multiple legal protections

YOUR TASK:

   - Anchoring strategy
   - How to frame the $1M value
